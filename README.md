# Bread-Board-Power-Supply-Pcb
📘 **Breadboard Power Supply PCB – First PCB Project (KiCad 9)**

  This repository contains the design files for my first-ever PCB project: a Breadboard Power Supply Module created using KiCad 9.
  This project marks my transition from Arduino-based prototyping to actual hardware design as I continue building my embedded systems engineering path.

🌟 **Project Overview**

  The Breadboard Power Supply provides regulated 5V and 3.3V outputs in a compact, breadboard-friendly layout.
  It is designed to power small embedded projects reliably and serve as a practical learning platform for understanding the complete PCB workflow.

**🔍 Motivation**

   After completing introductory Arduino projects like the Blinking LED and Obstacle Detection System, I wanted to move beyond simple prototyping and learn how hardware is really built.

   This project helped me:

   Understand fundamental PCB concepts

   Practice design workflows

   Take a real step into embedded hardware development

   This power supply module also solves a practical need: having a stable, easy-to-use power source for my breadboard experiments.

**⚙️ Key Features**

   1) Dual regulated outputs: 5V & 3.3V

   2)Based on: 7805 + LM317 voltage regulators

   3)Barrel jack input with on/off switch

   4)LED indicators for power status

   5)Screw terminals + header pins for flexible output

   6)Compact PCB size suitable for breadboard placement

   7)Clean layout optimized for beginners and prototyping

**📚 What I Learned (First PCB Experience)**

   Designing this board helped me understand the complete PCB creation process, including:

   Schematic design

   Footprint selection & mapping

   PCB layout and routing

   Design Rule Checks (DRC)

   Trace width and clearance basics

   3D board visualization

   Generating Gerber files for fabrication

   This project gave me confidence and a strong foundation to continue designing more advanced hardware.
